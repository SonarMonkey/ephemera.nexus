## Webbed Site

Things seem to have been well with the site since my last update! The site is building correctly, the formatting and styling is alright enough, and I haven't found anything super broken as of now. Still some polish I want to apply, which I'll talk about more below.

## Other Projects

Outside of this project, I've got some other stuff going on:

1. As usual, I've been tweaking my [NixOS Config](https://github.com/SonarMonkey/meninx). No major changes recently, mostly just keeping things up to date, but I have been trying out the [Zed Editor](https://zed.dev/). I might make a more in-depth post about that, but overall I think it's a neat and very promising project. I'm also considering making another attempt at fleshing out a complete [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) setup. I've made a few passes at this before, but I've always enjoyed the occasional deep-dive on tiling WM's when I inevitably get curious every few months.

2. I've also been considering getting back into [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon), inspired by a fellow [BRUH ZONE](https://friday-girl.neocities.org/bruhzone/) member's activity on [MUDII](http://www.mudii.co.uk/). Zhe's got a cool page about [dying in MUD2](https://friday-girl.neocities.org/mudii_deaths/) you should check out. First, though, I need to decide on a client. I've used [Mudlet](https://www.mudlet.org/) in the past, but I've always wanted to play with a TUI client so I also have my eye on [Blightmud](https://github.com/Blightmud/Blightmud).

3. I also have plans to get back into using an RSS reader for keeping up with cool web content as part of this whole foray into the personal web. Still thinking about what I want to set up and follow there, but that's in the works as well.

## What's Next

First, I want to tweak the overall styling of this site a bit more. I'm pretty happy with how it looks, but I do have a few things I'm not so keen on:

1. I think that title bar up there for each blog post looks kinda strange. Not sure what I want it to look like, but I don't like the layout right now.

2. I'd like a lot more of those little badges down there, and I'd like them to be a bit more chaotic. Strewn about, piled, maybe even animated. Who knows.

3. There could be a little more flair in general. Nothing crazy, but maybe a bit more going on with `<em>` tags and such. Also want to maybe animate more stuff just for the learning experience.

4. Later down the road I may overhaul the whole main layout a little bit. I've seen some things like chatboxes, status feeds, etc. that could go in a nice sidebar, and again it would just be more learning.

Second, I really wanna get started on the [Wiki](/wiki/). I have lots of notes and ideas, but haven't fleshed out the main page, or any articles for it. I think my first endeavour will be a set of beginner-friendly pages about tuning up the general experience of web browser, and I hope to work on that this week.

That's all for now! <3
